<body>
    <p>Even though I was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, I spent all my life in Edinburg, Texas which is located
        in the Rio Grande Valley. Growing in the RGV allowed me to be exposed to the Mexican culture while being 
        raised in the Filipino culture at home. I currently have three dogs, one Chihuahua and two German Shepherds.
        Sparks, my Chihuahua, is turning 13 yrs old this year and is the sweetest old dog. Luyong and Diwata, my white 
        German Shepherds, are currently 3 yrs old and are two of the most energetic dogs you'll ever meet.
