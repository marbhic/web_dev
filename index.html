        <p>Howdy! My name is Marielle Hicban, and I am a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>.
            I majored in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in biomaterials, and minored in 
            Computer Science. At the moment, I hope to further my academic education by pursuing
            a Masters in Biomedical Engineering or Computer Science. 
        </p>
